This is the playbook for **[Open Savannah](http://opensavannah.org)**, an official local brigade of [Code for America](codeforamerica.org). This playbook is open-source and available to view, edit or contribute to by any brigade members on GitHub.

Open Savannah is a volunteer civic tech organization dedicated to building technological solutions to local problems in the Greater Savannah, Ga Metropolitan Statistical Area. We believe that by partnering with local governments and advocating for open data policies, we can help shed new insight on community issues.
